# ReVAS

Retinal Video Analysis Suite: a utility for generating reference frames and extracting eye position traces from retinal videos recorded via scanning laser ophthalmoscopes. It also includes a set of tools for classifying eye movements into drifts and (micro)saccades, and extracting detailed information about these eye movements.

Developed in Dr. Susana Chung's Sight Enhancement Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley.

By Dr. Mehmet N. Agaoglu, Derek Wan, and Matt Sit, with contributions from Jason Chen and Alex Yeo
