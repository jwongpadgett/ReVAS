# ReVAS

Retinal Video Analysis Suite: a utility for generating coherent reference frames and eye position traces from scanning laser ophthalmoscopes, a standard method for Optometrists interested in analyzing eye movements.



Developed in Dr. Susana Chung's Sight Enhancement Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley.

By Dr. Mehmet N. Agaoglu, Derek Wan, and Matt Sit, with contributions from Jason Chen and Alex Yeo

Requirements: 
1. MatLab 
2. MatLab Computer Vision Toolbox

We hope to eventually write custom functions that will obviate the need for MatLab's Computer Vision Toolbox.
